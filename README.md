<h1>Overview</h1>
The weather app is a React based web application showing the real time weather data from Singapore. The data are pulled from the data.gov.sg API. 

This web application is created as a modification to the robofriends application taught in Udemy course "The Complete Web Developer in 2020: Zero to Mastery". I initiated this modification to improve the relevancy to Singapore and then using in to teach a React Fundamentals workshop for the NUS community. More details of the React Fundamentals workshop that I taught can be found here https://dscnustech.github.io/webdev.
